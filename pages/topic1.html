                <h3>What is Topic 1?</h3>
                <p>Topic 1 is an example topic page that shows how easy it is to add new content to your static site. The main index will automatically discover and link to this page.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Points About Topic 1</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>The main index.html auto-discovers and routes to this page</li>
                    <li>No framework is needed - this is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>You can add as many topic pages as you want</li>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For the auto-discovery to work in a real production environment, you would need to implement a server-side solution or a build-time process to generate a manifest of available pages.</p>
